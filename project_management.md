#Project Management

| Capability Level | Capability Name | Description | Observed Behaviour | Project Scope |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|0|Project Management: Minimal Agile|Development team projects follow agile principles.|Revenue generating feature development projects follow Agile principles.<br>**When development requires other subject matter experts they are pulled into the development process.**<br>Combined with incident responsibilities this forces operations and test engineers to context switch frequently.<br>**Projects that don’t directly generate revenue are ill-managed, poorly understood, underfunded and incorrectly prioritised.**|Expand scope of project management activities to include all projects whether they are focused on software, infrastructure, testing, security, data management or any other technology discipline.<br>**Create a mechanism to assist in the creation of good quality stories and development of new capabilities that is transparent to everyone in the organisation such as Behaviour Drive Development (BDD).**<br>Start measuring time from conception to delivered capability. Ensure timing stops when new features are considered stable and high quality not just when they are initially launched.|
|1|Project Management: Agile|All project activities follow agile processes|Stories exist to describe every deliverable within the technology organisation.<br>**Every team has evolved to participate in agile projects.**<br>Mechanisms are in place to assist in the creation of stories or use cases.<br>**Good engineering decisions are made in relation to the development of software but not in the provision of the service as-a-whole.**|Evolve design and planning process to include all necessary skills to ensure engineering decisions are made with reference to every aspect of service provision including time to market, service availability, performance, security, capital and operational expenditure.<br>**Define the costs of a day’s work for each engineering function in the technology department. Use these costs to ensure the actual costs of new feature development are well understood and can be weighed against the opportunity.**|
|2|Project Management: Continuous Improvement|Support tasks result in stories or use cases|Weaknesses observed during testing, incident management and day-to-day maintenance result in stories or use cases that are prioritised alongside new features by technical product managers who understand the technical and business implications of their decisions.<br>**Teams are still dependant on external functions outside their control in order to delivery value.**|Either embrace cross-functional teams ensuring all teams have the resources they need to build, launch, manage and support services on their own or focus on a programme of API building so teams can call upon infrastructure, security and data management services in order to build, launch, manage and support their services.<br>**No one team should be in a position so that a change in their priorities unduly impacts any other team.**<br>Teams should be free to prioritise providing essential services themselves or going to the market for them.<br>**Introduce a total cost of service provision to allow efficiency gains to be celebrated and allow the relative benefits of new features and stability improvements to be understood.**|
|3|Project Management: Continuous Delivery|Cross-functional teams use agile or service teams with APIs develop their services using agile techniques.|Service owning teams manage their own support and delivery activities and work alongside product managers to prioritise new features against deployment, capacity, performance, security and usability features.| |
