How to use the framework
------------------------

The Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework has been designed 
with two main goals in mind:

1. To allow organisations to assess their DevOps capability and 
to help prioritise projects to deliver improvements to existing
DevOps capabilities or to deliver new capabilities.

2. To articulate a series of projects that when completed 
individually progress an organisations capability and deliver
real-world value. The projects have been designed so that when 
each is completed the capabilities they delivery can be used 
together to deliver additional capabilities with very little 
additonal work
