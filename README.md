Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework

##What is it?

The Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework is an attempt to provide organisations with a structured approach to a DevOps transition.

The framework is presented so that anyone reading it can understand the nature and complexity of a transition to DevOps. It also allows organisations to choose which challenge to tackle first. Each project has been structured to provide clear benefits. In addition to this the framework presents further capabilities that can be made available to an organisation with a little extra work by combining the capabilities delivered by multiple projects.

[For additional context please read my blog entry announcing the framework](http://nextgendevops.com/2015/04/07/whats-next-for-next-gen-devops/)


##The Latest Version

This readme is the only publically accessible artefact of the Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework available at this time.

##Documentation

It is anticipated that this readme combined with the framework itself is sufficient documentation and so it is replicated on the wiki:
[https://github.com/grjsmith/NGDO-Transformation-Framework/wiki](https://github.com/grjsmith/NGDO-Transformation-Framework/wiki)
However should additional documentation be required that doesn't sit well within the framework or this readme it will be provided seperately in the wiki and this section of the readme will be updated accordingly.


##How to use the framework

1. Assess the organisation or project's current capability levels by reviewing the observed behaviours described at each capability level. By matching the description to behaviours observed in the organisation a level can be determined.
2. Repeat this process across all the capabilities. This will provide an indication of which projects will provide the most value.
3. Once it's been decided which capability needs to improve create a project or projects to deliver the scope described in the relevant project scope section. Once the additional capabilities have been determined reassess the capability and iterate until the observed behaviours in the organisation match those described in the next level.
4. Rinse and repeat
