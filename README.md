stage.

How to use the framework
------------------------

The Next Gen DevOps Transformation Framework has been designed 
with two main goals in mind:

1. To allow organisations to assess their DevOps capability and 
to help prioritise projects to deliver improvements to existing
capabilities or to deliver new capabilities.

2. To articulate a series of projects that when completed 
individually progress an organisations capability and deliver
real-world value. When each additional project is completed 
together they provide additional capabilities for little 
additional work.
